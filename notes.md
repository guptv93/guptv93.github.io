Notes? Why would anybody make notes in the 21st century? Just Google, bro!!

Personally, I've felt that preparing scribe notes is a valuable learning experience and one that allows you to internalize the material at a new level. They also help you to maintain a permanent record of what you have read or listened to and can be immensely helpful when you want to brush up for exams or interviews.

Find below, the links to my notes on Maths for Machine Learning. They are mostly scribes from the different classes that I attended (physically or virtually). Almost nothing in the notes is originally mine. They are collections of teachings, snippets and links that I've found useful. The intention has been to try to stitch them together coherently.
