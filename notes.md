*Notes? Why make notes? Why not just Google stuff that you can't recall?*

I personally feel that preparing notes is a valuable learning experience and one that allows you to internalize the material at a whole new level. It also helps you maintain a permanent record of what you have read or listened to and can be immensely helpful when you want to brush up for exams or interviews.


Find below, the links to my notes on Maths for Machine Learning. They are mostly scribes from the different classes that I've attended (physically or virtually). Almost nothing in the notes is originally mine. They are collections of teachings, snippets and links that I've found useful. The intention has been to stitch them together coherently, while sifting through the unnecessary details. Let me know when Google does that for you!
